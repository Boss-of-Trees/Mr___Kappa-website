    <h2>Being just a waiter is boring</h2>
    <h4>I believe that every waiter has to be a unique experience for the guests</h4>
    <div class="philosophy">
      <p>I always try to put as much humor into the interaction with guests as somehow possible. With this they feel way more pleasant in comparison to if they would have just been treated by a normal waiter. They feel more engaged and are thus forming an emotional connection with the restaurant. This can result in more frequent visits or even an increased willingness to stay longer and spend more. This of course helps the overall economic situation of the restaurant, but also can have positive effects on the guests psyche.</p>

          <p>Mr___Kappa is probaly the best and most humorous waiter I have ever met. When I spilled the water, he acted very calm and has forgiven my mistake with his own distinct kind of humour. Thank you</p>
